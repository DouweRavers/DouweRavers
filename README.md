# Douwe Ravers

Hi, my name is Douwe Ravers. I'm a Belgian engineering PhD student in rehabilitation games for powered wheelchair training. In my free time I regulary make small games, but like developing other stuff as well.

I like creating 3D applications, it being games, interactive web pages or VR software of any kind. My weapon of choice is the open source Godot Engine as it just so nice to work with, however I have worked with Unity many times as well.

In the future I hope to develop applications or software addressing environmental issues like the energy crisis or helping carbon emission reduction in various industries.
